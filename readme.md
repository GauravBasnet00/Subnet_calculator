## **Features**

The main features of this project are:

- It calculates the subet range of the given ip-address.
- It stores the calculated subnet range in a `Single` link list.
- It finds the range in which the given ip-address is located.

## **How It works?**

1. It asks for the four octate of an ip-address along with its cidr.
2. It checks which class the given cidr belongs to.
3. It then calculates the addition factor for individual class to find the network address and an another factor to find the broadcast address.
4. The calculated ip-address range is then store in a `Single` link list.
5. Then the given ip-address is checked to the linked list and the range is calculated
